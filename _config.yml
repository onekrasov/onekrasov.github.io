# Cayman-Specific Button Customization
# -----------------------
# These will appear as the large buttons in the header
# You can point them to your LinkedIn or a "Services" anchor
show_downloads: false # Set to false to hide default "Download on GitHub" buttons

# To add custom buttons in Cayman, you usually edit the index.md 
# or the layout, but let's keep the config clean for now.
